                My hobby is reading intersting and knowledgeable books in my free time.Whenever I go to home from school I like to read such books after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 5th standered. Now I know very well that reading is very good habit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good  of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
